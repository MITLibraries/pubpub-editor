Releasing daisy drive organisms constituting a small fraction of the local wild population can drive a useful genetic element to local fixation for a wide range of fitness parameters without resulting in global spread.

Element (A) disrupts one or more recessive genes required for female fertility. The presence of a single copy of the B element causes the A element to drive in the zygote or early embryo, ensuring that females are sterile but leaving males unaffected.  The C element is male-linked and causes the B element to drive, which can occur either in the germline as depicted or in the zygote or early embryo. The result is a male that produces sons like himself, but daughters that are sterile. These males should have fitness only slightly lesser than wild-type males and consequently should remain in the population for an extended period once released.  Since population reproductive capacity depends directly on the number of sterile females, which in turn depends on the fraction of males with the sterile-daughter trait, this architecture could permit reversible titration of the local population by releasing sterile-daughter or wild-type organisms.","size":"100%","align":"full","id":"57a22c0a5a4037b8e01abffe","className":"","source":"57a22c0a5a4037b8e01abffe"},"type":"embed"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"page_break"},{"content":[{"text":"Supplementary Applet 1","marks":[{"_":"strong"}],"type":"text"},{"text":"\n","type":"text"},{"attrs":{"data":{"content":{"height":"900px","source":"http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/erika-alden/daisydrive/blob/master/Daisy%20Drive.ipynb"},"parent":{"isPublished":true,"lastUpdated":"2015-12-23T21:33:09.209Z","createDate":"2015-12-23T21:33:09.209Z","slug":"57a22b6d5a4037b8e01a2059","previewImage":"https://assets.pubpub.org/_site/pub.png","title":"Iframe: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/erika-alden/daisydrive/blob/master/Daisy%20Drive.ipynb","tags":[],"_id":"57a22b6d5a4037b8e01a2059","type":"iframe","versions":[]},"message":"","type":"iframe","_id":"57a22c0a5a4037b8e01abfff"},"mode":"embed","caption":"","size":"","align":"full","id":"57a22c0a5a4037b8e01abfff","className":"","source":"57a22c0a5a4037b8e01abfff"},"type":"embed"}],"type":"paragraph"}],"type":"doc"}
